# Glass vs No-Glass Classification
Major Course Project for Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning (CSL2050) under the guidance of Dr. Richa Singh

## Description
This aim of this project is to determine if a person is wearing glasses or not. However, test subjects are not real people. A Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) created all of the people that you see in this dataset. The GAN network creates these images using a 512 number latent vector. Both the latent vectors and the faces produced by those vectors are provided.
